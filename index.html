            Twice (Korean: 트와이스; Japanese: トゥワイス), is a South Korean
            girl group formed by JYP Entertainment. The group is composed of
            nine members: Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun,
            Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu. Twice was formed under the television program
            Sixteen (2015) and debuted on October 20, 2015, with the extended
            play (EP) The Story Begins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Twice rose to domestic fame in 2016 with their single "Cheer Up",
            which charted at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart, became the
            best-performing single of the year, and won "Song of the Year" at
            the Melon Music Awards and Mnet Asian Music Awards. Their next
            single, "TT", from their third EP Twicecoaster: Lane 1, topped the
            Gaon charts for four consecutive weeks. The EP was the highest
            selling K-pop girl group album of 2016. Within 19 months after
            debut, Twice had already sold over 1.2 million units of their four
            EPs and special album; in 2019, they became the best-selling Korean
            girl group of all-time. The group has sold over 9 million albums in
            South Korea and Japan as of July 2020. In 2020, Twice signed with
            Republic Records for American promotions as part of a partnership
            with JYP Entertainment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The group debuted in Japan on June 28, 2017, under Warner Music
            Japan, with the release of a compilation album titled #Twice. The
            album charted at number 2 on the Oricon Albums Chart with the
            highest first-week album sales by a K-pop artist in Japan in two
            years. It was followed by the release of Twice's first original
            Japanese maxi single titled "One More Time" in October. Twice became
            the first Korean girl group to earn a platinum certification from
            the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for both an album
            and CD single in the same year. Twice ranked third in the Top Artist
            category of Billboard Japan's 2017 Year-End Rankings. They have been
            dubbed the next "top-trend girl group", and their point
            choreography—including for "Cheer Up", "TT" and "Signal"—became
            dance crazes and viral memes imitated by many celebrities.

            <li>MORE & MORE *Title</li>
            <p>
              The emotion of craving the lover as the excitement and sweetness
              of love matures is expressed as “MORE & MORE”. The tropical house
              rhythm makes the audience refreshed just by listening to the song.
              The refrain of the song has instrument sound and these lines are
              filled with a colorful yet fresh performance. Hit song maker J.Y.
              Park was in charge of lyrics and arranging and melted TWICE's
              bright and healthy energy into the song. Distinguished artists
              such as MNEK, Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Zara Larsson as
              well as BIBI who showed fantastic teamwork with J.Y. Park for
              “FEVER” added more flavor to the song.
            </p>
            <li>OXYGEN</li>
            <p>
              This song is full of TWICE’s cheerfulness. It says to a lover more
              precious than the air that this is the happiest and most complete
              moment. A bright shuffle rhythm was added to the fresh voices of
              the members.
            </p>
            <li>FIREWORK</li>
            <p>
              It is a Latin genre song and compares the emotions of love to
              fireworks. It makes you feel like you are watching fireworks in
              front of you.
            </p>
            <li>MAKE ME GO</li>
            <p>
              NAYEON writes the lyric of this song alone and the song asks a
              sweetie to come closer without hesitation. The
              gradually-increasing brass, the catchy chanting chorus, and the
              witty ad-lib of the TWICE members make good harmony.
            </p>
            <li>SHADOW</li>
            <p>
              The solid determination to confide hidden feelings is expressed
              using the tropical house and the 80s synthesizer sound.
            </p>
            <li>DON’T CALL ME AGAIN</li>
            <p>
              This song conveys a warning message to an ex-lover who has become
              history but cannot banish the lingering affection. It enhances
              softness and dynamics by employing the feeling of R & B, which was
              popular in the mid-90s.
            </p>
            <li>SWEET SUMMER DAY</li>
            <p>
              JEONGYEON was in charge of the lyrics and CHAEYOUNG created the
              rap. They melted the mindset of enjoying this moment into the
              lyrics. This song will make you feel fresh and cool in the coming
              summer.
