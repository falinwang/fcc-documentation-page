            Twice (Korean: 트와이스; Japanese: トゥワイス), is a South Korean
            girl group formed by JYP Entertainment. The group is composed of
            nine members: Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun,
            Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu. Twice was formed under the television program
            Sixteen (2015) and debuted on October 20, 2015, with the extended
            play (EP) The Story Begins.

            Twice rose to domestic fame in 2016 with their single "Cheer Up",
            which charted at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart, became the
            best-performing single of the year, and won "Song of the Year" at
            the Melon Music Awards and Mnet Asian Music Awards. Their next
            single, "TT", from their third EP Twicecoaster: Lane 1, topped the
            Gaon charts for four consecutive weeks. The EP was the highest
            selling K-pop girl group album of 2016. Within 19 months after
            debut, Twice had already sold over 1.2 million units of their four
            EPs and special album; in 2019, they became the best-selling Korean
            girl group of all-time. The group has sold over 9 million albums in
            South Korea and Japan as of July 2020. In 2020, Twice signed with
            Republic Records for American promotions as part of a partnership
            with JYP Entertainment.

            The group debuted in Japan on June 28, 2017, under Warner Music
            Japan, with the release of a compilation album titled #Twice. The
            album charted at number 2 on the Oricon Albums Chart with the
            highest first-week album sales by a K-pop artist in Japan in two
            years. It was followed by the release of Twice's first original
            Japanese maxi single titled "One More Time" in October. Twice became
            the first Korean girl group to earn a platinum certification from
            the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for both an album
            and CD single in the same year. Twice ranked third in the Top Artist
            category of Billboard Japan's 2017 Year-End Rankings. They have been
            dubbed the next "top-trend girl group", and their point
            choreography—including for "Cheer Up", "TT" and "Signal"—became
            dance crazes and viral memes imitated by many celebrities.
